The Catalyst network integrates and improves upon the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to create the Kat Virtual Machine (KVM) \cite{KVM}. This allows complex smart contracts to be run on Catalyst, as well allowing pre-existing smart contracts written in Solidity to be used on Catalyst. By extending the rand of Op-Codes that are used on the EVM, we can ensure that significantly more complex operations can be performed.
