Catalyst integrates its own Distributed File System (DFS) \cite{DFS} based on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol \cite{benet2014ipfs}. DFS as the name suggests are peer to peer file systems, where the files contained within are distributed across a range of peers (and thereby accessible to those peers). This file system unlike others that rely on centralized servers will have no down time nor are a single point of failure, meaning that they are persistent in a way that other file storage technologies are not. \\



On the Catalyst network every node holds a DFS module. This means that while all nodes will not hold all the information stored of the DFS they will be able to query and retrieve information that is of value to them. Furthermore, nodes will simply have the ability to query the existence of a file rather than being forced to download the file in order to check
its existence. \\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Integrating DFS allows the Catalyst network to remain lean as nodes on the network can choose to store only the data that they choose to hold. Furthermore, it allows the storage of many rich file types in a distributed manor, meaning that they are always accessible with no down time guaranteed. In this section is a description of the IPFS platform that Catalyst uses, and then how Catalyst integrates this into its ecosystem.
